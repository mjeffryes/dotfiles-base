Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Once we are done, save the spec as spec.md. Don't include any "future work" or next steps in the spec.md. Instead create a "future-work.md" to record these.

Here’s the idea: $ARGUMENTS
